# Rework Combat Bots

Combat robots have been unloved for too long by both the devs and the players.
This mod aims to bring them into the modern Space Age.

Each of the inner planets (Vulcanus, Fulgora, and Gleba) unlock a new combat robot.
The robots have been tweaked so that their function aligns more with their new planet and their name.
Robots have also been set to be combat targets, which they weren't before for some reason, so enemies will go out of their way to attack them.

## Defender Capsule

*Deploy three stationary combat robots with powerful guns but little armor to defend a location.*

Unlocked on Vulcanus after you have metallurgic science.
Fires depleted uranium rounds.

The objective is to let you turret creep without having to do the micro of turret creeping.
These robots are even more fragile than turrets, so it's not a good idea to throw them directly into the heart of a base.

## Distractor Capsule

*Deploy a fast robot that runs away from the player and attracts enemies towards it with the smell of delicious jelly.*

Unlocked on Gleba after you figure out jellynuts.
Does not do any damage, but leads enemies away from you.
It has a medium amount of health (same as a wall).
The distraction is not foolproof, and the enemies will quit following the capsule as soon as they see any other target in range.

Throw these into a base from far away to send the guards away, and try to destroy as many spawners as you can before they come back.
Pro tip: these build up speed over time, so it's best to throw them close to you so they have time to accelerate before they start distracting enemies.

## Destroyer Capsule

*Deploy a heavy-duty but somewhat unstable combat robot with a tesla gun.*

Unlocked on Fulgora after you unlock tesla guns.
It's the most like its vanilla counterpart; it fires electric arcs.
Unlike in vanilla, the arcs act like tesla ammo; they jump between targets and slow them down.

When they get destroyed or their timer runs out, they will enter a self-destruct sequence and explode into huge arcs of electricity that jump to *everything* in range.
This can be very powerful if one dies in the middle of a base, but be careful that it doesn't arc to you.

## Other miscellaneous changes

- Nerfed the follower count researches so they only add +5 per research, because each combat robot in this mod is more powerful than in vanilla.
