# Rework Combat Bots

Combat robots have been unloved for too long by both the devs and the players.
This mod aims to bring them into the modern Space Age.

Each of the inner planets (Vulcanus, Fulgora, and Gleba) unlock a new combat robot.
The robots have been tweaked so that their function aligns more with their new planet and their name.
Robots have also been set to be combat targets, which they weren't before for some reason, so enemies will go out of their way to attack them.

## Defender Capsule

*Deploy three stationary combat robots with powerful guns but little armor to defend a location.*

Unlocked on Vulcanus after you have metallurgic science.
Fires depleted uranium rounds.

They do a lot of damage, but cannot take very much fire before they are destroyed.

## Distractor Capsule

*Deploy a fast robot that runs away from the player and attracts enemies towards it with the smell of delicious jelly.*

Unlocked on Gleba after you figure out jellynuts.
It has a medium amount of health (same as a wall) and does not do any damage.
When spawned, distractors accelerate directly away from you, and any enemies in its range will follow it.
The distraction is not foolproof, and the enemies will quit following the distractor as soon as they see any other target in range.

No one knows why all known life-forms are attracted to the smell of jelly.

## Destroyer Capsule

*Deploy two heavy-duty but somewhat unstable combat robots with a tesla gun.*

Unlocked on Fulgora after you unlock tesla guns.
It's the most like its vanilla counterpart; it fires electric arcs.
Unlike in vanilla, the arcs act like tesla ammo; they jump between targets and slow them down.

When they get destroyed or their timer runs out, they will violently explode into huge arcs of electricity that jump to *everything* in range.

## Other miscellaneous changes

- Nerfed the follower count researches so they only add +5 per research, because each combat robot in this mod is more powerful than in vanilla.
